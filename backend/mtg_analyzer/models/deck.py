"""Models for parsed and resolved decklists.

A decklist is parsed into raw `DeckEntry` lines, then *resolved* against the local
card DB to attach the real `Card` (gameplay identity). Resolution is by name
(reliable, offline); the `(SET) #` suffix is kept for reference/printing display but
gameplay identity comes from the card name → oracle_id.
