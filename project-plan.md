# MTG Analyzer — Project Plan

> **Living document — the single source of truth** (per CLAUDE.md). Every agent reads this before
> starting and updates status/checkboxes when finishing a unit of work. Last updated: **2026-06-28**.

**Status — 152 tests, ruff + mypy clean.**

- **Phases 0–8: complete.** Feature-complete for local, chat-driven use: analyze, recommend, simulate,
  build-from-collection, combo/interaction Q&A, collection management + strategy guides, and a heuristic
  battle/matchup simulator. The only open items in 0–8 are **deferred to publishing (§7)** — the web
  views (Phase 3c/3d) and sim charts (Phase 5).
- **Phase 9 (battle simulator): the active frontier.** Replanned 2026-06-23 after a full 15-pod LOTR
  sweep showed the model ranked decks ~inverted vs. experienced play. The staged fix — and its full
  rationale, now **consolidated here from the former `simulator-v2-roadmap.md`** — lives in **§Phase 9**
  (Stages 0–3 + cross-cutting X1–X4). **Shipped to production → LOTR rank-distance 16 → 0:** Stage 0
  (win-clock correctness) + Stage 1 (mid-game attrition equity), then the breakthrough Stage 3c/3d
  (metagame-knowledge feedback loop + informed-table power ranking). Stage 2 (IS-MCTS search) was
  prototyped and **measured as no ranking gain → full build deferred**; Stage 3 politics audited as
  appropriately secondary.
- **Web app (Phase 10): the next frontier.** Per the 2026-06-27 readiness review, the engine core is
  web-ready; the missing foundations were a service layer, productized analytics, and a real spec —
  **P0 now shipped** (`service.AnalyzerService`; `head_to_head`/`power_tier`/pod sections in the engine;
  Phase 10 spec). **Next: P1** (sims-as-jobs, determinism, API schemas/hardening), then build the UI.
- **Simulator (Phase 9):** essentially landed (LOTR rank-distance 0). Remaining is optional polish —
  Stage 2's full IS-MCTS only if "skillful-timing realism" becomes a goal; simplify near-inert politics
  knobs; opportunistic anchor-gated corpus fit (X2).

## 1. Vision

A local, single-user tool for **Magic: The Gathering Commander (EDH)** players that:

- Ingests the user's **card inventory** and **decklists**.
- Bundles MTG rules knowledge: the **Comprehensive Rules** + **card-specific rulings** (Scryfall),
  plus a live link to Scryfall for card lookups, combos, and interaction questions.
- **Validates and scores** decks (Commander legality, color identity, curve, category balance,
  combos present).
- **Simulates** games statistically and reports consistency analytics (opening hands, mulligans,
  turn-to-cast-commander, turn-to-combo).
- Produces **upgrade recommendations** and a **budget-aware shopping list** — both from simulation
  output *and* from static deck analysis without running the sim.
- **Constructs decks** from the inventory (+ a shopping list for the gaps).

**Operating context:** runs entirely on Jacob's Mac, one user, no auth, no hosting. Publishing is a
future item (§7), and the architecture keeps it reachable.

## 2. Confirmed decisions (2026-06-17)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language / engine | **Python 3.11+** | Best fit for the data/analytics/simulation core; scipy/numpy; the data ecosystem (pyedhrec etc.) is Python. |
| Interface | **Chat-driven via Claude Code (primary)** — the engine is exercised through chat; Claude runs commands + interprets. **Web app (FastAPI + React) deferred** to the publishing phase (§7). | Updated 2026-06-17: user prefers chat over terminal/UI for personal use. Engine stays UI-agnostic so a web app can be added later for publishing. |
| First milestone | **Deck analysis + recommendations** (no simulator required) | User-chosen. Highest value per effort; works day one. |
| Card data | **Scryfall bulk data** ingested into local **SQLite**, keyed on `oracle_id`; live API only for autocomplete/fuzzy/ad-hoc search | Scryfall is the sanctioned, documented source; bulk is the right tool for inventory-scale work. |
| Simulation fidelity | **Statistical / heuristic goldfishing** (hypergeometric + Monte-Carlo). **No full rules engine.** | MTG is Turing-complete; a faithful engine is multi-year. Full rules-enforced play deferred to future (reuse XMage, MIT) — §7. |
| Combo detection | **Commander Spellbook** (MIT, open backend) via `/find-my-combos` + cached `/variants/` | Sanctioned open API; powers EDHREC's combo feature. |
| Recommendation data | **EDHREC** unofficial `json.edhrec.com` (via `pyedhrec`), cached nightly | De-facto Commander stats source; pair with Scryfall for all card data. |

## 3. Architecture

```
backend/mtg_analyzer/   Pure-Python engine (importable, testable without FastAPI)
  data/        Scryfall bulk download/refresh + local SQLite card DB
  models/      Pydantic: Card, Deck, Inventory, Ruling, Recommendation
  ingest/      Decklist + inventory parsers; resolve to Scryfall identity
  rules/       Commander legality; comprehensive-rules store; rulings lookup
  analysis/    Category + curve analysis; deck scoring
  combos/      Commander Spellbook client + matcher
  simulation/  hypergeometric (scipy) + Monte-Carlo (numpy) goldfish sim
  recommend/   recommender + deck construction + budget shopping list
  api/         FastAPI app (thin adapter over the engine)
frontend/      React + Vite + TypeScript SPA
data/          local card DB, bulk cache, rules text (gitignored, regenerable)
tests/         pytest
.claude/skills/ scryfall-api · commander-format · mtg-data-ecosystem
```

**Identity model:** every entity joins on Scryfall `oracle_id`. Resolution priority when parsing
files: `Scryfall ID → (set code + collector #) → (name + set) → name-only (flag ambiguous)`.

**Key data assets to treat as external + versioned (never hard-code):** Commander banned list,
"Game Changers" list (~53 cards as of Feb 2026), Frank Karsten color-source tables.

## 4. Phases & milestones

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done. Update inline as work completes.

### Phase 0 — Foundation  `[x]`
- [x] Research (Scryfall API, Commander rules + simulation feasibility, data ecosystem).
- [x] Repo init, directory skeleton, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `CLAUDE.md`, this plan.
- [x] Domain skills authored (`scryfall-api`, `commander-format`, `mtg-data-ecosystem`).
- [x] Python venv (3.11) + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`; `pytest`/`ruff`/`mypy` run clean.
- [x] FastAPI app + `/health` route (CORS for Vite origin); Vite/React-TS app shows backend status.
- [x] Initial git commit.

### Phase 1 — Card data layer  `[x]`
- [x] `data/bulk.py`: `/bulk-data` poller → stream-download **Oracle Cards** + **Rulings**, manifest
      tracks `updated_at`, re-downloads only when it changes. (httpx decodes gzip → plain JSON on disk.)
- [x] `data/db.py`: streaming ijson ingest into SQLite. `cards` keyed on `oracle_id` (+ `printings`
      keyed on `id` for price/set/image, + `rulings`). Indexes on name, front_name, ci_key, cmc,
      commander legality. Non-gameplay layouts (art series/tokens/emblems) flagged + deprioritized.
- [x] `models/card.py` (Pydantic) — Card/CardFace/Ruling with DFC handling driven off `layout`.
- [x] `data/scryfall_client.py` (httpx async, custom UA/Accept, ~100 ms throttle, 429 backoff):
      `/cards/named` (fuzzy/exact), `/cards/autocomplete`, `/cards/search`, `POST /cards/collection`
      (auto-chunked ≤75).
- [x] `data/scryfall_cache.py`: SQLite TTL cache (default 12h, matching the bulk-data refresh
      cadence) in front of every live-API call. `collection` caches per-identifier (both hits and
      not-found), so overlapping decklist/inventory resolutions cost one network round-trip total.
      Enabled by default (`ScryfallClient(cache=True)`); pass `cache=False` or a shared
      `ScryfallCache` instance to disable/share it.
- [x] Rulings lookup from bulk file, joined on `oracle_id`.
- [x] Tests (no network): ingest fixture, name/front-face resolution, DFC parsing, rulings join,
      client header/chunk/429 behavior via MockTransport. CLI `mtg data refresh` / `mtg card`.
- **Ingested 38,178 cards + 76,805 rulings locally (~9 s).** Name resolution verified on real data.

### Phase 2 — Ingest: decks & inventory  `[x]`
- [x] **Decklist parser** (`ingest/decklist.py`): tolerant `[SB:] N[x] Name [(SET) [#]] [*F*]
      [[Category]]` + section headers + `//`/`#` comments. Covers Archidekt-text, Moxfield/Arena/MTGO,
      and **ManaBox `.txt`** (`// COMMANDER` comment-markers + blank-line section reset). Card-name
      parens preserved (set group is space-free). `parse_deck` auto-detects **Archidekt CSV deck
      exports** (headerless, positional; commander via category, set/collector/section captured) vs
      text. *Validated on real exports: Sauron ManaBox txt → [BRU] 100 cards; Leonardo Archidekt csv
      → [BGRUW] 100 cards, 0 unresolved.*
- [x] **Inventory CSV parser** (`ingest/inventory.py`): ManaBox-first, header-driven (matches by
      normalized header, not position) → also reads Moxfield/Deckbox/Archidekt collection CSVs.
- [x] **Resolution** (`ingest/resolve.py`): **name-first** → oracle_id (reliable, unique), with
      scryfall_id / set+collector as fallbacks. Unresolved entries surfaced, not dropped.
      `data/inventory_store.py` persists inventory (per-printing rows, aggregate by oracle_id).
      Models: `models/deck.py`, `models/inventory.py`. CLI `mtg deck show`, `mtg inventory import|show`.
- [x] Tests (`test_ingest.py`): Archidekt/Arena parsing (foil, categories, the `Erase (Not the
      Urza's Legacy One)` name edge case), deck resolution, ManaBox CSV, inventory aggregation, and a
      regression for name-first (a mismatched set+collector must not override the name).
- **Validated on the real 38k-card DB:** Atraxa deck resolves to `[BGUW]`; a ManaBox CSV aggregates
  Sol Ring to owned 3 across 2 printings. Drop real exports in `data/` to harden further.

### Phase 3 — Deck analysis & validation  `[~]` ← **first user-facing milestone**
Staged: **3a** analysis engine (this) → **3b** recommender + shopping list → **3c** FastAPI routes →
**3d** React views.
- [x] **3a — Analysis engine** (`analysis/`, `models/analysis.py`). **Validation:** exactly 100,
      singleton (basics + "any number / up to N named" cards like Nazgûl/Relentless Rats exempt),
      legal commander check, `color_identity ⊆ commander identity`, banned + Game-Changer via Scryfall
      per-card fields (no hard-coded lists). **Category analysis:** heuristic classifier (type line +
      oracle-regex, Archidekt category as a hint) → counts vs Command-Zone targets (37 land / 10 ramp
      / 10 draw / 10 removal / 3 wipes) → gaps. **Curve:** nonland CMC histogram. **Bracket estimate**
      (1–5) from Game-Changer + tutor density (combo-refined in Phase 4). CLI `mtg deck analyze`.
      Tests in `test_analysis.py`. *Validated on real decks: Sauron → LEGAL, bracket 4 (4 Game
      Changers); the Nazgûl/signet cases drove two real fixes.*
- [x] **3b — Recommendations (blended, no sim):** `recommend/edhrec.py` (EDHREC client, throttled,
      resolves candidates by name) + `recommend/recommender.py`. Adds = EDHREC synergy cards
      classified into the deck's gaps (ramp/draw/removal/wipe), respecting color identity / singleton
      / not-in-deck / budget. Cuts = deck's lowest play-rate cards, protecting commander / Game
      Changers / singleton-override theme cards / **combo pieces** (cards used by a combo present in
      the deck — `recommend` fetches the deck's combos and passes them as protected). Buy cost +
      owned-aware (inventory). CLI
      `mtg deck recommend --budget`. Tests in `test_recommender.py`. *Validated on Sauron: 8 gap-
      filling adds (~$4.86) + 8 cut candidates; protects Sol Ring / Nazgûl / Game Changers.*
- [~] **3b — Budget shopping list:** buy cost + owned vs not-owned via inventory done. TODO:
      functional cheaper-substitute suggestions (same role, lower price).
- [~] **3c/3d — Web app (FastAPI routes + React views):** the old chat-first deferral is superseded —
      the web UI is now the **next frontier**, specced as **Phase 10** below (readiness checklist + MVP
      views + API contract). The `/health` FastAPI app + Vite scaffold remain the seed; the new
      `service.AnalyzerService` facade is the layer the routes call.

### Phase 4 — Combo & interaction detection  `[x]`
- [x] **Comprehensive Rules corpus (pulled forward).** `rules/comprehensive.py` auto-discovers the
      current rules `.txt` from magic.wizards.com, downloads + parses it (sections / categories /
      rules / subrules + glossary). `rules/store.py` stores it in `app.db` with FTS5 search:
      exact rule lookup, subrule expansion (GLOB letter-class, not LIKE), ranked full-text search
      over rules + glossary. CLI `mtg rules refresh|get|search|glossary`. Tests in `test_rules.py`.
      *Ingested 3,294 rules + 730 glossary terms (effective 2026-04-17).*
- [x] **Commander Spellbook client** (`combos/client.py`): live `/find-my-combos` (authoritative —
      resolves `requires` templates server-side; returns included + almost-there buckets) and a
      per-card `/variants/?q=card:"…"` search. Conservative ~3 req/s pace + exponential 429 backoff.
      **On-demand, not a full mirror:** find-my-combos covers all ~90.5k commander-legal combos
      server-side (always current), so we query live + cache rather than scraping 900+ pages — which
      tripped the API's rate limit and is poor citizenship (their own guidance: self-host the MIT
      backend for true bulk; deferred to §7).
- [x] **Local combo cache** (`combos/store.py`): caches fetched combos in `app.db` (combos +
      combo_cards on `oracle_id`); `add` (cache-through upsert) + `combos_using` + offline
      `find_in_deck` (uses-based; template combos confirmed via the live endpoint). CLI
      `mtg combos card|find`. Tests in `test_combos.py` (incl. a regression for a pagination
      infinite-loop bug where an empty `params={}` stripped the `next` URL's query).
- [x] **Combos wired into deck analysis:** `mtg deck analyze` calls find-my-combos and lists combos
      present; the bracket estimate now factors combo count (a two-card combo → bracket 3+). Graceful
      offline degradation (`--no-combos`). *Sauron → detects Fall of Cair Andros + Blasphemous Act.*
- [ ] Suggest color-identity-legal combos to *add* (the live "almost included" bucket already
      provides one-card-away suggestions — surface them in recommendations).
- [x] **Interaction/ruling Q&A** (`rules/qa.py`, `models/qa.py`): `explain_card` (oracle text +
      official rulings + CR rules for the card's keywords + glossary + combos), `search_knowledge`
      (free-text FTS over rules + glossary), `explain_interaction` (both cards' grounding + combos
      between them). CLI `mtg explain "<card or question>"` and `mtg interaction "<a>" "<b>"`. The
      engine *retrieves grounded sources*; Claude synthesizes the answer in chat. Tests in
      `test_qa.py`. *Demo: Blasphemous Act → 4 rulings + 10 combos; the Fall of Cair Andros + Blasphemous
      Act interaction pulls the "excess damage = above lethal" ruling + Amass rule.*

### Phase 5 — Game simulation & analytics  `[~]`
- [x] **Hypergeometric module** (`simulation/probability.py`, scipy): exact P(≥k of a group in N
      draws), `cards_seen_by_turn`, `p_see_by_turn`. Models the 99-card library.
- [x] **Monte-Carlo goldfish** (`simulation/goldfish.py`, numpy seeded RNG): `DeckProfile.from_resolved`
      (land/ramp/cmc arrays), London-mulligan keep-2–5 policy, turn loop (land drop, ramp deploy,
      commander-castable check). Engine separate from policy. Honestly approximate: single mana pool,
      no colored requirements, ramp = +1 from next turn.
- [x] **Metrics** (`models/simulation.py`): avg opening lands, keepable%, exact P(≥3 lands),
      flood/screw rates, avg mulligans, commander-castable turn (median/mean/p90/never%). CLI
      `mtg deck simulate [--games --draw]`. Tests in `test_simulation.py` (incl. determinism).
      *Sauron: 79% keepable, 50% P(≥3 lands), 1% screw, commander castable median T7.*
- [x] **Feed sim into the recommender:** `mtg deck recommend` now simulates **before/after** the
      proposed swaps and shows the delta (keepable / screw / commander-turn), and the recommender
      weighs sim signals (slow commander or high screw → boosts ramp priority, with an explanatory
      note). `apply_swaps` builds the hypothetical post-swap deck. Sub-`band` deltas shown as "≈ same"
      to avoid labeling sim noise. *Sauron: swaps pull commander median turn 7 → 6.* `--no-sim` to skip.
- [x] **turn-to-combo metric** (combo-awareness Layer 1): the goldfish sim tracks the turn any combo
      assembles — pieces drawn (or tutored), commander pieces free from the command zone, redundancy =
      earliest across all combos, mana-gated by the priciest piece. `simulate(deck, combos=…)` →
      `SimResult.combo_turn`/`combo_count`; shown by `mtg deck simulate` (`--no-combos` to skip).
      Reveals real structure: Tom assembles ~T8 (6 tutors), while Sméagol's 8 *shared-piece* variants
      don't beat a clean 2-card combo (~T11). 3 tests.
- [x] **combo-awareness Layer 2**: `build_profile` now grounds a *non-aggro* combo deck's battle clock
      in its goldfish `combo_turn` (blended with the archetype estimate, since `combo_turn` assumes
      hardcasting; aggro/cheat decks keep their faster combat clock), and combo redundancy tightens
      `clock_sd`. `BattleProfile.combo_count` added; the battle CLI now passes combos to the goldfish.
      Clocks vary with actual combo composition instead of a flat archetype constant (Sauron 9.0→9.6,
      Tom 7.3→7.7, Sméagol stays T4.8). *Absolute scaling is the calibration target (real-game fit).*
- [ ] sim charts (deferred with the web UI).

### Phase 6 — Deck construction from inventory  `[x]`
- [x] **`recommend/builder.py`**: `build_deck(commander, owned, db, edhrec_cards, *, budget,
      owned_only)`. Greedy build over EDHREC recommendations ∪ owned cards (filtered to identity +
      Commander-legal): fills functional targets (37 land / 10 ramp / 10 draw / 10 removal / 3 wipe)
      owned-first then by synergy, then payoffs, then a manabase (owned nonbasic lands + basics split
      by color). `models/build.py`.
- [x] **Output:** decklist grouped by category with owned ✓ / buy $ markers + a shopping list and
      total cost. Budget cap (skips buys over budget, reports if short). `--owned-only` mode. Notes
      report category shortfalls.
- [x] **`mtg deck build "<commander>" [--budget] [--owned-only]`** + **`mtg deck suggest-commanders`**
      (legal commanders in your collection, by popularity). Tests in `test_builder.py`.
      *Demo: full 100-card Sauron list from EDHREC staples ($311 buy); $20-budget → 84/100; owned-only
      with the tiny test inventory → 40/100 with clear shortfall notes.*
- Seeds from EDHREC recommendations (∩ inventory via owned-first). Manabase upgrade
  (duals/fetches) is a future refinement.

### Phase 8 — Collection management & strategy guides  `[x]`
- [x] **Unified inventory with locations** (`data/inventory_store.py` + `data/collection.py`): one
      `data/inventory.csv` (master, with a **Location** column) + per-deck files in `data/decks/`.
      Imported "extra" CSVs = the **Available** pool; every registered deck's cards are merged in
      `Location = <deck slug>`. `mtg inventory import|sync|show`; `deck save` auto-syncs. Migration
      adds `location` to pre-existing inventory tables.
- [x] **Availability-gated recommend/build:** upgrades/building only use cards that are Available
      (or already in the target deck) — a card committed to another deck isn't suggested
      (basics/"any number" exempt). `inventory show --card` lists where each copy lives.
- [x] **Strategy guides** (`analysis/guide.py`): `mtg deck guide <name>|--all` composes a pilot's
      1-page markdown guide (game plan, win cons + combo lines, mulligan from sim, sequencing, key
      cards, at-a-glance) → `data/guides/<slug>.md`. Grounded in analysis + sim + Commander Spellbook.
- [x] **Win-condition analysis** (in `guide.py`): the Win conditions section now follows deck-primer
      best practice — names a **Primary** path and **Backups** (redundancy), and for each combo
      classifies its produced features as **terminal** (wins outright) vs. an **engine** that needs an
      outlet, then names the payoff card in the deck that converts it (or flags *no outlet — gap*).
      Adds a **kill-on-sight** line (combo pieces to protect). Near-duplicate combo variants are
      capped (top 6 by popularity, rest collapsed to a count) to keep guides to ~1 page.
- [x] **Combo-less decks get the same depth** (in `guide.py`): guides no longer collapse when a deck
      has no Spellbook combo. The win plan is recovered from the deck itself — deck-wide **finishers**
      detected from card text (drain/aristocrats, group-slug, overrun/anthem, combat-amplifier, burn,
      alt-win) reusing the outlet machinery; an **Engine lines** section parallel to Combo lines; a
      kill-on-sight line over the detected payoffs; and an **archetype label** (from real deck signals:
      creatures, instants/sorceries, token-makers, symmetric draw, +1/+1 counters, interaction, ramp)
      that tunes the Game plan + Sequencing prose. Fixes thin/mislabeled guides for precon-level decks
      (e.g. Bloomburrow Zoraline now reads as aristocrats with a Psychosis-Crawler/drain kill, not
      "Combat"). Same grounded-no-invented-strategy rule.
- *Validated on real data: 1,043 distinct cards imported (0 unresolved); Sol Ring tracked across
  Available + 3 decks; Henzie guide lists all 3 combos with steps; Galadriel's infinite-token engine
  correctly names Craterhoof Behemoth as its outlet.* 139 tests; ruff/mypy clean.

### Phase 7 — Polish & quality  `[x]`
- [x] **Saved deck library** (`data/deck_library.py`): `mtg deck save|list|remove|diff`; all deck
      commands accept a saved name *or* a file path (`load_deck_text`). Decks stored as text under
      `data/decks/` (gitignored). `deck diff` shows added/removed cards between two decks. *(Auto
      version-history snapshots deferred — diff covers the practical need.)*
  - [x] **Human-named deck files** (`slugify` via NFKD accent-strip + tolerant `_find`): a file
        dropped into `data/decks/` as `Frodo and Sam.txt` / `Sméagol.txt` resolves by display name,
        slug, or canonical form, robust to macOS NFD vs. NFC; `save` overwrites the existing file
        instead of creating a slug-named duplicate. Covered by `test_collection.py`.
- [x] **EDHREC caching** (`EdhrecCache`): 24h TTL in `app.db`; `recommend`/`build` reuse cached
      commander data (cold 1.14s → warm 0.67s, no network). Scryfall bulk refreshes via the manifest.
      *A scheduled nightly cron is an ops concern (run `mtg data refresh` + `mtg rules refresh`).*
- [x] **Error/offline handling:** all network calls (Commander Spellbook, EDHREC) route through
      `_run_network` — on failure they print a clear "unavailable (offline or rate-limited); skipped"
      note and degrade gracefully; unresolved cards are reported, never silently dropped.
- [x] **Quality pass:** 81 tests; ruff + mypy clean. Engine logic 85–100% covered (CLI/bulk
      downloader are thin glue, exercised via real runs). Perf on the full 38k-card DB: card lookup
      ~2 ms, parse+resolve a 100-card deck ~35 ms, analyze ~1 ms.

### Phase 9 — Heuristic battle/matchup simulator  `[~]` ← **active frontier**

Pod-aware **1v1 + 4-player** match simulator that abstracts each deck to a `BattleProfile` (clock,
interaction, card advantage, resilience, combo, threat) derived from existing `analyze()`/`simulate()`
signals, then runs a heuristic turn loop with interaction trades and (4-player) politics/threat
assessment. **Explicitly not a rules engine** (plan §2 / golden rule #5) — outputs are *relative* win
rates with **sensitivity bands**, never card-accurate. Design rationale + module layout:
**[docs/battle-simulator-design.md](docs/battle-simulator-design.md)**; literature backing:
**[docs/simulator-research.md](docs/simulator-research.md)**.

> **Replanned 2026-06-23 — this section is the single source of truth, absorbing the former
> `simulator-v2-roadmap.md`.** A full 15-pod LOTR sweep ranked the decks ~inverted vs. experienced play
> (rank-distance 16/18); root cause: the model was **monocausal on speed** and its "clock" measured
> commander-*deploy* turn, not *win* turn (**Appendix A**). The literature ([docs/simulator-research.md](docs/simulator-research.md)
> Part II) says realistic multiplayer win rates come from **searched decisions over a stochastic abstract
> state** with politics as a **secondary** opponent-model layer — not a single power scalar nudged by
> hand-tuned knobs. The staged fix below; status is tracked inline (✅ shipped · ◐ prototyped · ☐ open).

#### Guiding principles (from the research)
- **P1 — Strategy primary, politics secondary** (tactics outweigh politicking ~14× in the best
  multiplayer-AI evidence; politics modulates *who is targeted*, it must not *determine* outcomes).
- **P2 — Realism lives in stochastic structure, not detail** (resample hidden state every trial; a cheap
  randomized rollout beats an expensive deterministic one).
- **P3 — Search, don't hand-threshold** (hold-vs-commit interaction, who-to-answer, go-for-the-win-now
  should be *searched* so reactive play and answer-wars emerge).
- **P4 — Right tool, not the fanciest** — IS-MCTS yes; CFR / full AlphaZero self-play no.
- **P5 — Honesty over false precision** — relative win rates + joint uncertainty bands, validated by
  *ordinal* stylized-facts.
- **P6 — Calibrate on patterns, not a corpus** — no literature backs fitting a heuristic sim to logged
  games; ordinal anchors (the LOTR ranking) are the workhorse, a corpus fit is opportunistic.

#### Staged roadmap & status
- **Stage 0 — correctness (stop the bleeding)  `[x]` SHIPPED 2026-06-23.** Decoupled the win-clock from
  the deploy/attempt clock: `BattleProfile.combo_clock` carries the goldfish combo-assembly turn for any
  *incidental* combo, and `_play_match` gates the combo-win path on the combo actually being online
  (`turn ≥ combo_clock − COMBO_ONLINE_SLACK`) — so a fast aggro deck with a late backup combo wins by
  **beatdown at its combat clock**, not an instant turn-3 combo. Recorded the `LOTR_RANKING` ordinal
  anchor + `test_anchor_lotr_ordinal_ranking`. **Result: rank-distance 16 → 10.**
- **Stage 1 — richer equity than a scalar clock  `[x]` SHIPPED 2026-06-23.** A param sweep proved
  re-weighting existing levers was inert (games end ~T9; the old inevitability tiebreak only fired at
  T24, so a slow interaction-dense deck had **no win path**). Added a **mid-game attrition/grind win
  path** (`grind_equity` + per-turn attrition draw; `ATTRITION_*`/`GRIND_*`): past `ATTRITION_MIN_TURN` a
  game can resolve by grind, weighted by interaction + card advantage + resilience/protection + combo
  redundancy, with a **heat discount** (the perennial archenemy can't *also* win the grind) and a
  **margin gate** (fires ∝ how far the leader out-grinds the field mean → ≈0 on even/mirror tables,
  protecting the speed anchors). **Result: 10 → 4** (Sauron last → 2nd, Frodo 1st → last; the inversion
  is gone). 1.2/1.3 (hypergeometric answer-availability; intransitive matchup term) **deferred** — 1.1
  alone hit the target. **Decision gate: Stage 2 search is now optional polish, not a fix.**
- **Stage 2 — searched decisions (abstract forward model + IS-MCTS)  `[~]` PROTOTYPED; full build NOT
  committed.** All in `simulation/battle_search.py` (separate from production `battle.py`). **2.1 gate
  PASSED:** an explicit, resumable, card-agnostic forward model (`BattleState` + `play_from(state, rng,
  decide)`, a `decide` policy seam) reproduces production *exactly* (LOTR dist 4, identical win rates) —
  proving the abstraction is expressive enough to search on. A flat determinized-search prototype
  (`make_search_decide`: roll out K times under COMMIT vs WAIT, pick the winner) was then **measured:
  search does NOT improve the ranking** (K=8 → dist stays 4); it adds skillful-timing texture (shifts
  share toward optimal-play combo decks) at ~4× compute. With Stage 1 already at the anchor, this
  **confirms the gate: do not commit the multi-week full UCB-tree IS-MCTS build for the ranking.**
  Prototype kept as a tested foundation if "skillful-timing realism" ever becomes the explicit goal.
- **Stage 3 — politics as a secondary opponent-model module  `[~]` AUDITED + 3c/3d SHIPPED.** The
  research validates the existing workstream-F politics (CICERO-style voting/perception is
  literature-backed) and prescribed two checks, both done evidence-based:
  - **3.2 audit (the 14× "tactics dominate" guardrail):** ablating each politics layer over the 15 LOTR
    pods shows fundamentals **alone** rank well (all-politics-off → dist 6) and politics merely *refines*
    to dist 4 → **appropriately secondary, no down-weighting needed**. The refinement is almost entirely
    the **perception/lightning-rod** mechanism (remove → dist 8); the coordination/equity-gate/spoiler
    knobs are **near-inert on the ranking** (flagged for a future simplification pass).
  - **3.1 grounded opponent-model coordination** prototyped (`battle_search.py`, opt-in
    `GROUNDED_COORDINATION`, default off): each defender free-rides on the *other* defenders' answering
    capacity (depends only on others → no self-referential collapse). Reproduces the ranking exactly at
    calibrated strength; kept opt-in (a fidelity improvement, not an outcome change).
  - **3b standing-strength targeting — documented dead-end** (`THREAT_DOMINANCE_W`, default 0): ganging
    up on the resource leader *widens* the spread and scrambles the ranking. **You can't politics away a
    real power gap** — focusing the strongest deck just hands the win to the next-strongest in its tier.
  - **3c metagame-knowledge feedback loop  `[x]` SHIPPED — the breakthrough.** Target by who is *known*
    to win, not static pre-game power. Feed each deck's realized win rate back as a standing threat prior
    (`win_prior = win_rate − 1/pod_size`) via a **damped fictitious-play loop** (`simulate_metagame`, CLI
    `mtg battle --metagame`; `WINRATE_PRIOR_W`/`METAGAME_*`). Damping kills the undamped overshoot.
    **Converges in ~5 passes to rank-distance 0 — a perfect match to the experienced-player ranking**
    (Sauron last → 1st; Frodo's archenemy 84% → 68%; spread 33pp → 27pp). Opt-in (standing
    `WINRATE_PRIOR_W` default 0 → one-off `mtg battle` unchanged); side-effect-free.
  - **3d informed-table assumption  `[x]` SHIPPED — the archenemy now tracks power.** A deck that wins by
    attrition is invisible to the live-threat read (Sauron's `live_threat` is the lowest at the table),
    so after the loop *learns* power levels, a final reporting pass runs at a strong
    `METAGAME_INFORMED_WEIGHT` so the table targets by **known** power. Reframe baked into the output:
    **power level = the ranking + archenemy column; win rate = the policed outcome** (the
    correctly-policed leader wins less; under-the-radar decks inherit — the empirical ~11%-archenemy
    pattern). `MetagameResult` reports `power_rank`/`power_level`/`archenemy_rate`/`win_rate`; CLI prints
    `#  deck  power  archenemy%  win%`. The cranked weight is applied only in the reporting pass
    (convergence stays at the stable weight).
- **Cross-cutting — calibration & honesty (continuous):**
  - **X1 — POM ordinal stylized-facts = PRIMARY validation** (the LOTR anchor + the 7 ordinal facts gate
    every change; P6: no corpus-NLL fitting).
  - **X2 — keep 9C-1 logging; 9C-2/9C-3 corpus fit downgraded to opportunistic / anchor-gated** (off the
    critical path — "not needed yet," not "blocked"). Detail under *Real-game logging & fitting* below.
  - **X3 — honest joint uncertainty bands** (shipped: `sensitivity.py` LHS global SA + `mtg battle
    --sensitivity`), extendable with **docking (E3)** — require the heuristic and search models to agree
    distributionally; divergence localizes bugs.
  - **X4 — metagame / Nash-averaging evaluation layer** (orthogonal sanity check on archetype shares vs.
    EDH-meta intuition; low priority).

#### Sequencing & decision gate
Stages 0 and 1 are pure-heuristic, low-risk, independently shippable; **Stage 1 hitting the anchor (dist
4) made Stage 2 optional**, and Stage 3c/3d then closed it to **dist 0**. Stage 2 (the architectural
search bet) stays gated on 2.1 — already proven — but is deferred because it adds skill-texture, not
ordinal accuracy. X1–X4 run continuously.

#### Non-goals (research-reinforced)
- **No card-level rules engine** (golden-rule #5): no stack/priority/targeting/resolution; the forward
  model is card-agnostic abstract resources only (life, mana, board-development, answers-held,
  combo-progress).
- **No CFR core solver** (wrong concept for 4-player non-zero-sum) and **no full AlphaZero RL self-play**
  as the product (data/compute prohibitive). **Politics never primary** (P1).

#### Key risks & open questions
- **R1 — abstract-state expressiveness** underpins the whole search bet → mitigated by the 2.1 gate
  (validated against Stage 1 + the LOTR anchor before any MCTS build).
- **R2 — 4-player tuning gap:** the MTG MCTS evidence is 1v1; determinization count + rollout noise for a
  4-player FFA are unproven → sweep them under the sensitivity harness.
- **R3 — calibration without a corpus** → lean on ordinal POM (X1), don't over-build the fit engine.
- **R4 — politics over-weighting regression** → the ordinal anchor suite catches it.
#### Build phases A–C (shipped — the pre-replan foundation)
The original Phase 9 shipped in build phases **A** (`BattleProfile` mapper + 1v1/pod match loop +
`battle_params` + sensitivity bands; 6 invariant tests in `test_battle.py`), **B** (a decentralized
per-player threat-assessment + voting engine → consensus archenemy; per-game archenemy/died-first
metrics), and **C** (finite-reserve interaction so pods resolve mid-game; `calibrate_match` + `mtg battle
--calibrate`; clock-vs-equity explainability via `DeckWinStats.rank_shift`/`explain`; the anchor-fixture
validation harness + a seeded-RNG fix for a seat-order bias it caught). The blow-by-blow is in the **§8
status log**; these phases map to the staged roadmap via the continuity table below. *(The original Phase
C "politics retuning" — flat `POLITICS_ARCHENEMY/NONARCH_ANSWER` multipliers — was superseded by
workstream F2's equity-gated answer check.)*

#### Real-game logging & fitting (9C → cross-cutting X2)
- [x] **9C-1 logging infra** — `models/match_log.py` (`LoggedGame`, validated) + `data/match_log.py`
      (append-only JSONL, surfaces malformed rows) + CLI `mtg matchlog form|add|list` (interactive form +
      scriptable `add`, sharing `_record_game`; stores the full as-played `BattleProfile` per deck;
      `list` shows raw observed win rates + corpus progress).
- [ ] **9C-2 fit engine / 9C-3 apply + guardrail** — NLL of observed winners over ~3–4 knobs
      (`INTERACTION_ANSWER_BASE`, `ANSWER_COORDINATION`, `THREAT_PROXIMITY_W`), scipy Nelder-Mead,
      regularized toward defaults, written to a reversible `data/`-local override gated by the anchor
      fixtures. **Downgraded to opportunistic (X2 / P6):** off the critical path — ordinal anchors are
      the workhorse, so this is "not needed yet," not "blocked on a corpus." Design:
      **[docs/battle-calibration-fitting.md](docs/battle-calibration-fitting.md)**.

#### Workstream A–H → stage continuity map (history)
The 2026-06-20 four-track literature review framed the work as research workstreams **A–H** (rationale +
citations in **[docs/simulator-research.md](docs/simulator-research.md)** Part I). The 2026-06-23 replan
re-prioritized them into the Stage 0–3 + X1–X4 structure above; the old priority order
(`D → A → E → F → C → B → G/H`) is retired. The letters are preserved only to tie shipped work to the
stages — these are *research* workstreams, distinct from the build phases A–C above (the A↔A overlap is
coincidental):

| Old WS | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| **A** — stochastic grounding | partial (A1 shipped; A4 *claimed* but was the speed bug) | **A4 → Stage 0.1**; A2 → Stage 1.2 (deferred); A1/A3 → Stage 2.2 determinization |
| **B** — intransitive matchups | not started | **Stage 1.3** (deferred polish) |
| **C** — metagame Nash layer | not started | **X4** (low priority) |
| **D** — honest uncertainty | shipped | **X3** (extend with docking E3) |
| **E** — POM validation | partial | **X1** (promoted to PRIMARY validation) |
| **F** — commander politics | shipped F1–F5 | **Stage 3 foundation** (audited secondary; detail below) |
| **G** — robustness probes | later | later (needs a broader deck pool) |
| **H** — corpus fit | = 9C | **X2** (downgraded to opportunistic / anchor-gated) |

- [x] **Workstream F — commander-politics realism (shipped F1–F5; the Stage 3 foundation).** Re-bases
      threat/answer/gang-up on real EDH pod play; spec
      **[docs/commander-politics-model.md](docs/commander-politics-model.md)**, validated against ordinal
      stylized-facts (not magnitude anchors). Empirical anchor (50 logged games): the **archenemy seat
      wins ~11%**, well below the 25% fair share. Knobs live in `battle_params.PRIORS`.
      - [x] **F1 — perception split + reputation/lightning-rod bias.** Targeting keys off
            `perceived_threat = live_threat × archetype-visibility + reputation` (not true equity).
            `BattleProfile.visibility` (combo 0.70 / grind 0.82 / else 1.0); a lightning-rod
            `reputation` accumulator bumps the consensus archenemy each turn and decays (×0.80),
            keeping the table on it semi-independent of board state. Reproduces **archenemy < 1/N**
            (visible fast combo 0.19 in a fair pod), the **quiet-shark** mechanism (identical decks:
            visibility-0.7 deck wins 0.62 vs ~0.13), and a **coordination knob** (archenemy win falls
            as answer-base rises). New knobs added to `PRIORS` for global SA. 2 ordinal POM tests;
            120 total, ruff+mypy clean.
      - [x] **F2 — equity-gated, free-rider-discounted answering.** Replaced the flat
            `POLITICS_ARCHENEMY/NONARCH` multipliers with a sequential, most-invested-first answer
            check: willingness = `answer_prob` × peer-relative own-equity gate × lethal gate
            (combo/archenemy > beatdown) × a flat `ANSWER_COORDINATION` factor (the §3.6 / casual↔cEDH
            knob). The naive "P(someone else answers)" free-rider product was tried and rejected
            (unstable — universal deferral collapses coordination); the flat factor is the robust
            stand-in. Coordination knob verified monotone; archenemy holds ~0.16–0.20 < 1/N; attrition
            emerges from reserve depletion. Both pre-F deck anchors kept passing by setting the new
            beatdown lethal-gate to 0.65 (no anchor rewrite). New knobs in `PRIORS`. 1 POM test; 121
            total, ruff+mypy clean.
      - [x] **F3 — go-first penalty + standoffs; spoiler-on-leader.** Attempts are suppressed while
            opponents hold open answers (`GO_FIRST_CAUTION` × table open-reserve) so decks wait out a
            standoff that F2 attrition breaks; an out-of-contention seat (trailing share, late game)
            answers the leader at boosted willingness (`SPOILER_ANSWER_BONUS`), overriding its equity
            gate. Verified: more caution ⇒ longer games; spoiler ⇒ leader win drops. The
            `pod_blunts_a_fast_deck` anchor was converted to ordinal here (research-led, per E2). 2 POM
            tests; 123 total, ruff+mypy clean.
      - [x] **F4 — protection cancels answers ~1:1; full archetype-visibility table.**
            `BattleProfile.protection` scanned from oracle text in the battle module (free counters /
            hexproof / ward / can't-be-countered / indestructible grantors — no analysis-pipeline
            change). Each landed answer is spent (attrition) but fizzles with probability
            `PROT_CANCEL_PER_PIECE × protection` (capped) — probabilistic per attempt, since a flat 1:1
            count made one piece protect forever (0.68!). Verified monotone (0.15→0.26→0.62→0.88 as
            protection rises). Visibility table completed: combo<grind<control<midrange<aggro. 3 POM
            tests; 26 battle tests, ruff+mypy clean.
      - [x] **F5 — power presets + POM stylized-fact suite.** `POWER_PRESETS` (casual | mid | cedh)
            bundle table coordination (§3.6), perception sharpness, and go-first discipline; applied
            via `simulate_match(preset=…)` + CLI `--preset`. Added `GO_FIRST_IMPATIENCE` so caution
            decays past a deck's clock (fixes a go-first deadlock that pegged slow pods at the turn
            cap). Pacing emerges from decks (cEDH pod ~5–6, casual ~14; ordinal cEDH < casual). All 7
            §3 stylized-facts codified as ordinal POM tests. 4 POM tests; 130 total, ruff+mypy clean.

#### Appendix A — LOTR pod validation (the finding that triggered the replan)
*Status: RESOLVED — Stage 0 + Stage 1 took rank-distance 16 → 4, and Stage 3c/3d closed it to **0**.
Preserved as the diagnostic that motivated the replan (folded in from the former
`lotr-sim-validation-findings.md`); reproduction scripts in [docs/research-assets/](docs/research-assets/).*

A full sweep of all `C(6,4) = 15` four-player pods over the six saved LOTR decks (2000 games/pod, seed 1,
combos on) ranked the simulator **near-perfectly inverted** vs. an experienced player's ground truth
(rank-distance 16/18; fair share in a 4-pod = 25%):

| Player rank (experience) | Sim rank (pre-fix) | Sim avg win% | Pod wins (of 10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Sauron        | 6th | 4%  | 0 |
| 2. Tom Bombadil  | 3rd | 21% | 1 |
| 3. Galadriel     | 4th | 17% | 0 |
| 4. Gandalf       | 5th | 5%  | 0 |
| 5. Sméagol       | 2nd | 28% | 4 |
| 6. Frodo and Sam | **1st** | **74%** | **10** |

**Root cause — the "clock" measured commander DEPLOY turn, not WIN turn.** Raw goldfish signals showed
real kill-speeds bunched **T8.5–T10.9** (the decks are near-identical in speed), yet the clock driving the
sim ranged T3.5→T9.6 — almost entirely commander *deploy* turn. Two compounding errors: (1) expensive
commanders read as "slow = weak," backwards for resilient grind/value decks; (2) an aggro deck with an
*incidental* combo (Frodo, classed `aggro` by the old `creatures ≥ 27` rule) scored an **instant combo
win at T3.5** because `has_combo` was true, even though its combo can't assemble until ~T9.

**The fix.** Stage 0.1 (real combo-assembly clock) halved the error (16 → 10); Stage 1's mid-game
attrition/inevitability win path closed most of the rest (10 → 4); Stage 3c/3d's metagame feedback +
informed table took it to **0**. The ordinal `Sauron > Tom > Galadriel > Gandalf > Sméagol > Frodo` is
captured as `LOTR_RANKING` (`test_anchor_lotr_ordinal_ranking`), the first calibration anchor.
**Reproduce** (from `app/`, venv active): `python docs/research-assets/run_all_pods.py` runs all 15 pods +
the per-deck summary; `diagnose.py` dumps the raw goldfish signals; `experiment.py` is the clock-source
counterfactual. CLI spot-check: `mtg battle <four decks> --games 2000`.

### Phase 10 — Web app (UI)  `[~]` ← **next frontier**

The chat-first interface stands; the web app is now the active goal. The review (2026-06-27) found the
engine core web-ready (print-free, model-returning, cached) but three foundations missing. **P0 (the
prerequisites a UI literally calls) is now shipped; P1 is the next work; then build the UI.**

#### Pre-web readiness checklist
- **P0.1 — service/facade layer `[x]`** (`mtg_analyzer/service.py`, `AnalyzerService`). One place owns
  the deck-name → models orchestration (resolve → combos → analyze → goldfish → battle-profile → …)
  that was trapped in the 1,273-line CLI. Returns engine models, never prints; best-effort network
  with a `notes` list; manages DB/cache/inventory lifecycle (context manager). CLI handlers
  (analyze/simulate/guide/battle/metagame/recommend/build) refactored to call it; the API will too.
- **P0.2 — productized analytics `[x]`.** The metagame table, **`head_to_head` 1v1 matrix**,
  `power_tier`, per-deck pod ranges, and the guide **Pod-matchup / Matchup-tendencies** sections now
  live in the engine (`simulation/battle.py` + `analysis/pod_sections.py`), wired into `build_guide`
  via `extra_sections` and `service.pod_analysis`/`guide(pod=…)` + CLI `mtg deck guide --pod`. They no
  longer depend on the throwaway scratchpad scripts, so the shipped tool (and the UI) can reproduce them.
- **P0.3 — this spec `[x]`** (web MVP + API contract below).
- **P1 — foundations (mostly shipped):**
  - **Determinism `[x]`** — the real cause wasn't goldfish RNG (the goldfish is seeded, `seed=0`); it was
    that `has_combo`/`combo_turn` came from the *live* Commander Spellbook lookup, so a deck classified
    differently offline vs. online (e.g. Galadriel combo→midrange). Fixed: `service.find_combos` is now
    **cache-backed + offline-robust** (live → cache-through; offline → local `ComboStore` match), so a
    deck's profile (archetype/clock/tier) no longer depends on network reachability.
  - **API serializability `[x]`** — `service.to_jsonable` (via `pydantic_core`) serializes every return
    (Pydantic models + the battle/service dataclasses, nested); `DeckMetagameStats.tier` promoted from a
    property to a derived field so it serializes. Offline/rate-limit parity via the service `notes` list.
  - **Sims-as-jobs `[x]`** — `jobs.JobRunner` (thread-pool, pollable status/progress/result, error
    capture); `simulate_metagame(on_progress=…)` reports per-pass; `service.metagame`/`pod_analysis`
    thread it through. The web API owns a `JobRunner` and submits `lambda report: svc.metagame(…,
    on_progress=report)`. **Still open (with the UI):** full versioned route schemas; **honesty in the
    UI** (bands + "relative, not predictive", per docs/sim-results-table-spec.md).
- **Deferred past the first UI:** 9C-2/3 corpus fit, Stage 2 IS-MCTS, cheaper-substitute shopping
  suggestions, "suggest combos to add."

#### Web MVP — views (read-first; mutations come later)
1. **Deck** — import/select → analysis (validation, composition vs targets, curve, bracket, combos).
2. **Pilot guide** — the `build_guide` markdown, incl. the pod sections when a pod analysis exists.
3. **Battle / metagame** — single pod (`simulate_match`) + pool metagame (`simulate_metagame`) + the
   1v1 matrix, rendered in the canonical results-table format.
4. **Recommend / build** — upgrade list (before/after sim delta) + build-from-collection shopping list.

#### API contract (thin routes over `AnalyzerService`)
- `GET /health` (exists). `GET /decks`, `GET /decks/{name}/analysis`, `/simulation`, `/guide`,
  `/recommendations`; `POST /battle`, `POST /metagame`, `POST /head-to-head`, `POST /build`.
- Routes are **thin**: construct/share one `AnalyzerService`, call it, return models; surface
  `service.notes` as a `warnings` field. **Versioned, deliberate response schemas** — Pydantic models
  are returned directly; the battle dataclasses (`BattleProfile`, `MatchResult`, `DeckMetagameStats`,
  `MatchupStats`) need Pydantic mirrors or `TypeAdapter` serialization (P1).
- **Sims are jobs, not sync** (P1): `POST` returns a job id; poll `GET /jobs/{id}` for progress/result.
  Goldfish/single-pod are fast enough to stay sync; metagame/h2h/sensitivity go async. The service
  methods are sync (run async clients via `asyncio.run`); an async API wraps them in a threadpool.
- **Single-user/local first** (CORS already pinned to the Vite origin); auth/multi-user is §7.

## 5. Recommendation engine design (reference)

Four-stage funnel (full detail in the **`mtg-data-ecosystem`** skill):
1. **Candidate generation** — union of: EDHREC top/high-synergy cards for the commander;
   co-occurrence/CF neighbors from a decklist corpus; Scryfall theme/`otag` queries per category gap.
2. **Score** — weighted blend of EDHREC **lift** (primary "fit"), CF similarity, category-gap
   demand, curve-smoothing, theme match, owned-bonus, minus price penalty. α-blend fit↔theme for
   cold-start commanders.
3. **Hard filters** — color-identity legal, not banned, singleton, ≤ budget (unless owned).
4. **Rank + diversify** — category quotas / MMR so output fills gaps (not 15 mana rocks). Attach
   human-readable explanations ("+72% synergy, fills ramp gap 6/10, owned, $0").

## 6. Risks & open questions

- **Decklist corpus for CF** — EDHREC gives aggregate stats but not raw decklists for co-occurrence.
  Options: rely on EDHREC lift/synergy alone initially; optionally build a small local corpus from
  Archidekt search (tolerated, throttled) later. *Decision deferred to Phase 3/5.*
- **EDHREC/Archidekt are unofficial endpoints** — could change or lock down (Moxfield already did).
  Mitigation: cache nightly, isolate behind an adapter interface, degrade gracefully to
  Scryfall-only analysis.
- **Commander Spellbook bulk** — single-file dump was removed; page `/variants/` or self-host MIT
  backend. *Decide in Phase 4.*
- **Comprehensive Rules ingestion format** — parse the official PDF/txt into searchable sections;
  scope the granularity in Phase 4.
- **Frontend depth** — start minimal (import → report → charts); avoid over-building before the
  engine is proven.

## 7. Future / post-MVP

- **Publishing** — multi-user hosting, auth, accounts, persisted collections. Engine already
  separated from UI; FastAPI → containerize; React app → static host. Re-review Scryfall/EDHREC ToS
  for any non-local/commercial use.
- **Full rules-enforced simulation** — integrate **XMage** (MIT, Java) as a play engine if true
  game AI is ever needed, rather than building a rules engine.
- **Self-hosted Commander Spellbook backend** (MIT, Docker) — if a complete *offline* combo mirror
  is ever wanted, run their backend locally instead of scraping the public API's 900+ variant pages
  (which trips rate limits). Until then, live find-my-combos + per-card search + cache suffices.
- **Price tracking over time**, alternate formats (Brawl, Oathbreaker), playtest/draft modes.
- **Heuristic battle/matchup simulator (1v1 + 4-player)** — pod-aware multiplayer *dynamics* model
  (clock/interaction/card-advantage/politics), NOT a rules engine. Scoped in
  [docs/battle-simulator-design.md](docs/battle-simulator-design.md); tracked as **Phase 9** below.

## 8. Status log

> Earlier history (Phases 0–8 and the pre-replan Phase 9 build, **2026-06-17 → 2026-06-22**) is
> archived in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). This log keeps the current frontier — the 2026-06-23
> replan onward. Entries are chronological (oldest first).

- **2026-06-23** — **Validation + replan + Stage 0 shipped.** A full 15-pod LOTR sweep showed the battle
  sim ranks decks **~inverted** vs. experienced play (rank-distance 16/18) — root cause: the "clock"
  measured *commander-deploy* turn, not *win* turn, and an aggro deck merely *containing* a combo scored
  **instant turn-3 combo kills**. A deep external-literature review
  ([docs/simulator-research.md](docs/simulator-research.md) Part II) + the validation (Phase 9
  Appendix A) drove a research-grounded
  **replan** (now consolidated into Phase 9 above): Stage 0 correctness → Stage 1
  multi-factor equity → Stage 2 determinization+IS-MCTS search → Stage 3 opponent-model politics (POM-
  ordinal validation primary; corpus-NLL fitting downgraded). **Stage 0 shipped:** `BattleProfile.combo_clock`
  decouples the win-clock from the deploy/attempt clock — an incidental combo only wins once *assembled*
  (`turn ≥ combo_clock − COMBO_ONLINE_SLACK`); aggro decks with a late combo now win by **beatdown** at
  their combat clock, and the combo blend was narrowed to combo-*primary* decks. Backward-compatible
  (synthetic/combo-primary profiles fall back to `clock_mean`). Added `test_anchor_lotr_ordinal_ranking`
  (the first POM ordinal ground-truth gate). **LOTR rank-distance 16 → 10** (Frodo & Sam 74% → 31%;
  resilient Tom/Galadriel rose to the top). 131 tests, ruff+mypy clean. *Open (Stage 1):* Sauron still
  under-ranked + Sméagol low — the speed-monocausal weighting the next stage fixes. Also corrected a
  stale **A4-shipped** marker in the A–H tracker (it was never actually shipped — it was this bug).
- **2026-06-23** — **Stage 1 shipped (richer equity — the speed-monocausal fix).** A param sweep first
  proved that re-weighting existing levers was inert (Sauron 10%→15%, rank-distance stuck at 10): games
  end ~T9 and the inevitability tiebreak only fired at turn 24, so a slow interaction-dense deck had **no
  win path**. Added a **mid-game attrition/grind win path** (`battle.py` `grind_equity` + the per-turn
  attrition draw; `battle_params` `ATTRITION_*`/`GRIND_*`): once past `ATTRITION_MIN_TURN` a game can
  resolve by grind, winner drawn weighted by grind-equity^GRIND_POWER (interaction-heaviest + card
  advantage + resilience/protection + combo redundancy). Two refinements make it precise: a **heat
  discount** (grind-equity ÷ accrued archenemy reputation, so the perennial lightning rod can't also win
  the grind — this swaps quiet Sauron above focused Frodo) and a **margin gate** (firing ∝ how far the
  leader out-grinds the field MEAN through a sharp logistic — ≈0 when resource-even, protecting the
  speed/mirror anchors; hard in a lopsided pod). **LOTR rank-distance 10 → 4** (Sauron last → 2nd, Frodo
  1st → last; the original inversion is gone). Tightened `test_anchor_lotr_ordinal_ranking` (gate 12 → 8,
  + a Sauron > Frodo assertion); recalibrated `test_anchor_pod_blunts_a_fast_deck` (a lone control deck
  now grinds a glass-cannon combo to ~0.52 heads-up — the intended correction; the pod still crushes it
  to 0.06). Anchors hold: speed 0.905, grind 0.90, mirror symmetric. 131 tests, ruff+mypy clean. *Open:*
  Sauron #2 not #1 + a Gandalf/Galadriel mid-table swap — finer strategic texture for Stage 2 (search)
  / Stage 3 (opponent modeling). Stage 1 hitting the anchor makes **Stage 2 optional polish**, not a fix.
- **2026-06-23** — **Stage 2 prototyped (searched decisions); full build NOT committed — evidence-based.**
  Built the make-or-break **2.1 gate** in a new `simulation/battle_search.py` (separate from production
  `battle.py`): an explicit, **resumable, card-agnostic forward model** (`BattleState` + `step_turn` /
  `play_from(state, rng, decide)`) with a `decide` **policy seam** for the win-attempt commit. The
  heuristic policy faithfully ports Stage-1's mechanics and **reproduces production exactly** (LOTR dist 4,
  identical win rates) — proving the abstraction is expressive enough that search on it is trustworthy.
  Then prototyped the research's **determinization + cheap-rollout** (`make_search_decide`: roll the rest
  of the game out K times under COMMIT vs WAIT, pick the winner) on the go-first/hold-up decision.
  **Measured: search does NOT improve the ranking** (K=8 → dist stays 4); it shifts share toward
  optimal-timing combo decks (Tom 42→48%, Galadriel 28→40%, Sauron 34→29%) at ~4× compute — skillful-play
  texture, not ordinal accuracy. With Stage 1 already at the anchor, this **confirms the decision gate: do
  not commit the multi-week full UCB-tree IS-MCTS build for the ranking; Stage 3 (politics) is higher
  value.** Prototype kept as the validated foundation (5 tests incl. the 2.1 gate; ruff+mypy clean).
  136 tests total. Full IS-MCTS + visit-count ensembling remains the documented next increment if
  "skillful-timing realism" is ever the explicit goal.
- **2026-06-23** — **Stage 3 politics audited + prototyped; existing politics CONFIRMED, no production
  rebalance.** The research validates the workstream-F politics (CICERO-style voting/perception is
  literature-backed) and prescribes two checks, both done evidence-based. **Audit (3.2 / the 14×
  "tactics dominate" guardrail):** ablating each politics layer over the 15 LOTR pods shows the
  tactical/resource fundamentals alone already rank well (ALL-politics-off → dist 6) and politics merely
  *refines* to dist 4 → politics is **appropriately secondary, no down-weighting needed**; that
  refinement is almost entirely the **perception/lightning-rod** mechanism (remove → dist 8, Frodo
  rebounds 8→21%), while the coordination/equity-gate/spoiler knobs are **near-inert on the ranking**
  (flagged for a future simplification pass). **Grounded opponent-model (3.1):** prototyped a stable
  CICERO-lite bystander model in `battle_search.py` (opt-in `GROUNDED_COORDINATION`, default off) — each
  defender free-rides on the OTHER defenders' answering capacity (depends only on others → no collapse,
  fixing the instability the flat-knob comment documented); measured to **reproduce the ranking exactly
  (dist 4)** at calibrated strength, over-strong free-riding mildly degrades it (dist 6, archenemy slips)
  — a fidelity/principle improvement, not an outcome change, so kept opt-in. **Human-regularization
  (3.3)** already present via `PERCEPTION_NOISE` + `PRIORS`. 137 tests, ruff+mypy clean.
- **2026-06-23** — **Stage 3b/3c (user-driven): metagame-knowledge feedback loop SHIPPED — LOTR
  rank-distance 4 → 0.** Re-running the full 15-pod sweep, the user observed the win-rate spread was too
  wide and the archenemy was wrong: a never-wins aggro deck (Frodo) was the turn-1 archenemy 84% of the
  time while the quiet winner (Sauron) was never targeted (0%). **3b (negative result):** tried ganging up
  on the static resource leader (`THREAT_DOMINANCE_W`) — it *widens* the spread and scrambles the ranking,
  because grind-equity mis-predicts winners and a resource-dense deck survives being targeted (you can't
  politics away a real power gap). Kept opt-in/default-off as a documented dead-end. **3c (the fix, the
  user's idea):** feed each deck's REALIZED win rate back as a standing threat prior (`win_prior =
  win_rate − 1/pod_size`, added to `perceived_threat` past the quiet-shark discount) via a **damped
  fictitious-play loop** — `simulate_metagame` + CLI `mtg battle --metagame` (`WINRATE_PRIOR_W` /
  `METAGAME_PRIOR_WEIGHT`/`DAMP`/`ITERS`; `BattleProfile.win_prior`). Damping kills the undamped overshoot
  (target winner → it loses → oscillate). **Converges in ~5 passes to LOTR rank-distance 0 — a perfect
  match to the experienced-player ranking**: Sauron last → 1st (prior +0.10, now drawn as a threat),
  Frodo's archenemy share 84% → 68% (prior −0.13, left alone at game start while the dynamic terms still
  flag it if it takes off), real winners Tom/Gandalf draw the heat, spread 33pp → 27pp. Opt-in
  (standing `WINRATE_PRIOR_W` default 0 → one-off `mtg battle` unchanged); `simulate_metagame` restores
  all global state. 1 new test (`test_metagame_feedback_*`). 138 tests, ruff+mypy clean. **First politics
  mechanism that improves the model on every axis — ranking, archenemy realism, and spread.**
- **2026-06-23** — **Stage 3d (user-driven): INFORMED-TABLE assumption — the archenemy now tracks power.**
  The user pushed: a 37%-win deck (Sauron) being the archenemy only ~4% of the time is wrong; assume
  players understand power levels, which should drive the strongest deck near the top of the archenemy
  ranking. Diagnosis confirmed: Sauron wins by **attrition**, which is invisible to the threat read (its
  `live_threat` is the LOWEST at the table, 5.8 vs Frodo's 19.2), and forcing the prior weight high enough
  to target it (a) oscillates and (b) over-suppresses (Sauron → 14% win, archenemy 56%). Resolution: the
  fictitious-play loop LEARNS power levels at the stable weight, then `simulate_metagame(informed=True)`
  runs ONE reporting pass at the strong `METAGAME_INFORMED_WEIGHT` (100) so the table targets by known
  power. Quantified the regime: casual → archenemy backwards; **informed → archenemy tracks power (Sauron
  near top, Frodo→5%), win rates compress toward parity.** Baked the reframe into the API/CLI output —
  **power = the ranking + archenemy column; win rate = the policed outcome** (the correctly-policed leader
  wins less; 2nd/3rd under-the-radar decks inherit, the empirical 11%-archenemy pattern). `MetagameResult`
  now reports `power_rank`/`power_level`/`archenemy_rate`/`win_rate`; CLI prints `# deck power archenemy%
  win%`. The cranked weight is applied only in the reporting pass (convergence stays stable). Metagame
  test updated to the power-ranking semantics. 138 tests, ruff+mypy clean.
- **2026-06-25** — **Full-pool metagame sweep + guide refresh (user-driven).** Ran every
  **C(13,4) = 715 four-deck pod** across all 13 saved decks (1,000 games/pod, seed 1) through both the
  naive pass and the Stage 3c/3d fictitious-play loop (`simulate_metagame`).
  Repro script: [docs/research-assets/run_all_pods_fullpool.py](docs/research-assets/run_all_pods_fullpool.py)
  (builds each `BattleProfile` once in the master and ships it to workers via a Pool initializer — spawn-safe,
  no per-worker rebuild/network; faithfully mirrors `simulate_metagame`'s damped loop + informed reporting
  pass). **Regenerated the `Pod matchup outlook (sim)` section in all 13 guides** (`data/guides/*.md`):
  previously 7 carried a stale 5–6-deck LOTR-only pool and 6 had none; all 13 now share one 715-pod pool
  with deck-specific naive/informed/range/takeaway prose **plus an embedded full-pool power-ranking table
  (with a power-level column, this deck's row bolded)** for calibration. (Sections remain hand-composed from
  the sim output, not auto-emitted by `mtg deck guide`.)
- **2026-06-25** — **Stage 0.4 (fix #1) + blitz-value reclassification (fix #2) — aggro was systematically
  under-rated (user-flagged via Henzie).** The full-pool run put Henzie — a strong, fast deck — **dead last
  (power #13)**. Diagnosis (soft-pod isolation: Henzie + the 3 weakest decks): it was classed **aggro,
  clock T4.5**, but T4.5 is a *deploy* clock, not a pod *kill* clock — beatdown converts ~0–3% in this model
  (it can't chew through 120 life + 3 blockers, and there's no overrun mechanic), so Henzie was archenemy
  **89%** of turns yet won only via its *incidental T11 combo*: all of the heat, none of the kill. Root cause
  = the same deploy-clock≠win-clock bug Stage 0 fixed for combos, still live on the beatdown path, **plus** a
  misclassification (Henzie is a big-mana blitz/value deck — avg CMC **4.3**, 22 cards at 6+ MV — not aggro).
  **Fix #1** (`ARCHETYPE_CLOCK["aggro"]` 1.5→2.8 offset, sd 1.0→1.7): the aggro clock is now a realistic pod
  kill-clock (the real deploy-speed kernel survives via aggro `visibility` 1.10). **Fix #2** (`_archetype`
  gated on `AGGRO_MAX_AVG_CMC = 3.6` via new `_avg_cmc`): a top-heavy creature deck is no longer mislabeled
  aggro (Henzie → midrange; no LOTR deck reclassifies). Re-snapshotted the LOTR anchor from live builds —
  **rank-distance improved 4 → 2**, all invariants hold (Sauron > Frodo, Galadriel > Sméagol, Frodo < 25%).
  2 archetype unit tests added/updated; **140 tests, ruff + mypy clean.** Reran the 715-pod sweep (converged
  in 5 passes); Henzie **#13 → #11**, naive archenemy **70% → 56%**, and at an informed table it posts a
  competitive **30% win** — no longer the phantom lightning rod, now read as a solid mid-tier deck rather than
  the worst. **Final learned power ranking (informed):** Sauron (+0.12) ≈ Tom Bombadil (+0.12) > Galadriel
  (+0.10) > Gandalf (+0.04) > Mishra (+0.03) ≈ Ms. Bumbleflower (+0.03) > Zoraline (+0.01) > Sméagol (−0.06)
  > Frodo (−0.07) > Cowabunga (−0.07) > Henzie (−0.08) ≈ Zinnia (−0.08) > Bello (−0.09). The two combo titans
  lead raw win% (49/52%) but draw the most informed heat (57/90% → policed to 20/27%); the fast decks
  (Frodo 78%, Sméagol 61% **naive** archenemy) finish last raw yet inherit the **highest informed wins**
  (~29–30%) once the table learns who the real powers are — the clock≠equity / quiet-shark / inherit-the-win
  effects.
- **2026-06-25** — **Canonical simulation-results table format (user-driven, research-backed).** Researched
  how comparable tools present win-rate/metagame data (17Lands: lead with one least-biased metric, suppress
  sub-sample values; MTGGoldfish/mtgdecks/Untapped: deck · share · win% · count, grouped into S/A/B tiers;
  win-rate-with-uncertainty practice; data-table design science) and defined ONE canonical schema for every
  results surface — spec: **[docs/sim-results-table-spec.md](docs/sim-results-table-spec.md)**. Caption
  (pods · games/pod · seed · informed · "heuristic, relative") then **`# · Deck · Tier · Naive · Informed ·
  Arch%`**, numerics right-aligned, sorted by learned power, focal row bold. **Tier** = realized meta
  strength S→D via new `power_tier()` (midpoint cutoffs +0.085/+0.025/−0.025/−0.085 so equal-displayed
  powers can't split a boundary) — kept distinct from the build-based **Bracket**. The naive↔informed gap
  *is* the honest band. Wired through: `DeckMetagameStats` gains `naive_win` + a `tier` property;
  `simulate_metagame` runs a Phase-0 naive baseline sweep; `mtg battle --metagame` and the repro script
  print the canonical table; all 13 guide tables regenerated to it (`# · Deck · Tier · Naive · Informed ·
  Arch%`). 2 tests (`test_power_tier_boundaries` + metagame field asserts); 141 tests, ruff + mypy clean.
- **2026-06-25** — **Guides: added a `Matchup tendencies (1v1)` section (user-driven — "what types of
  decks will this commander beat vs. be careful against").** Ran the full head-to-head matrix (all
  C(13,2) = 78 deck pairs, 3,000 games/pairing, seed 1) — repro:
  [docs/research-assets/run_h2h_matchups.py](docs/research-assets/run_h2h_matchups.py). For each deck the
  section reports its avg heads-up win% **by opponent archetype** (combo/midrange/aggro), the specific
  **favored** (≥55%) and **careful** (≤45%) opponents, and a one-line read. The 1v1 lens cleanly isolates
  the matchup and the model's anchored 1v1 facts show through: **combo is the wall** (nearly every fair
  deck is a heavy dog to Sauron/Galadriel/Tom), fast decks dominate duels (Tom 78% avg, Frodo 68% — no
  losing matchup for Tom), and the section explicitly flags the **1v1↔pod divergence** (Frodo wins the
  duel yet ranks near-last in 4-player because politics gang the fast clock). Inserted after the pod
  outlook in all 13 guides; data-driven bullets + per-deck hand-written reads. (Guides are gitignored,
  regenerable.)
- **2026-06-27** — **P0 web-readiness shipped (service layer + productized analytics + Phase 10 spec).**
  From the readiness review (below), did all of P0. **P0.1 — `service.AnalyzerService`:** a single
  facade owning the deck-name → models orchestration that was trapped in the 1,273-line CLI (resolve →
  combos → analyze → goldfish → battle-profile → metagame/h2h/guide/recommend/build); returns engine
  models, never prints, best-effort network via a `notes` list, DB/cache/inventory lifecycle as a
  context manager. Refactored the core CLI handlers onto it and deduped `is_legal_commander_card`.
  **P0.2 — productized analytics:** added `head_to_head` (the 1v1 matrix) + `OpponentMatchup`/
  `MatchupStats` and per-deck pod ranges (`pod_wins`/`naive_min|max[_pod]`) to `simulation/battle.py`;
  new `analysis/pod_sections.py` renders the **Pod-matchup outlook** + **Matchup-tendencies** sections
  (data-driven, canonical table via `power_tier`), wired into `build_guide(extra_sections=…)` and
  `service.pod_analysis`/`guide(pod=…)` + CLI `mtg deck guide --pod`. These no longer depend on the
  throwaway scratchpad scripts — the shipped engine reproduces them. **P0.3 — Phase 10 spec** (readiness
  checklist + web MVP views + thin-routes-over-the-service API contract + sims-as-jobs) added above.
  5 new tests (`head_to_head`, `power_tier`, 3× `pod_sections`); **145 tests, ruff + mypy clean.** Did
  NOT regenerate the 13 on-disk guides (their bespoke prose is richer than the templated engine output;
  the capability is what P0 required — `mtg deck guide --all --pod` regenerates via the engine anytime).
  **Next: P1** (sims-as-jobs, archetype determinism, API response schemas/hardening).
- **2026-06-28** — **P1 web-readiness foundations shipped (determinism + API serializability + sims-as-jobs).**
  **Determinism:** root-caused the archetype instability — not goldfish RNG (seeded `seed=0`) but the
  *live* combo lookup making `has_combo`/`combo_turn` network-dependent (a deck flips combo↔midrange
  offline). Fixed `service.find_combos` to be **cache-backed + offline-robust** (live → `ComboStore`
  cache-through; offline → uses-based local match), so a deck's profile is stable regardless of network.
  **API serializability:** `service.to_jsonable` (pydantic_core) serializes all returns incl. the battle
  dataclasses; `DeckMetagameStats.tier` promoted property→derived field so it serializes. **Sims-as-jobs:**
  new `jobs.JobRunner` (thread pool, pollable progress/result/error) + `simulate_metagame(on_progress=…)`
  per-pass reporting, threaded through `service.metagame`/`pod_analysis` — the API will submit long sims
  to a `JobRunner` and poll. 7 new tests (3 service, 2 jobs, 1 metagame-progress, 1 serialization);
  **152 tests, ruff + mypy clean.** Remaining for the UI phase: versioned route schemas + UI honesty
  framing. **P0+P1 done → ready to build the web app.**
- **2026-09-15** — **Bracket Engine pipeline wired end-to-end** (separate track, see
  [docs/spec/bracket-engine.md](docs/spec/bracket-engine.md), not a phase above): decklist text →
  `BracketService.analyze_decklist` (parse → resolve → `bracket_adapter.to_assessment_deck` →
  `BracketEngine.analyze` → `bracket_report.render_markdown`) → `POST /api/v1/analyze`. Kept out of
  `service.AnalyzerService`/`pyproject.toml` deliberately — this fork tracks an `upstream` remote and
  those files are still upstream-identical; the new orchestration lives in the fork-only
  `bracket_service.py` instead (opens its own sqlite connection per call — FastAPI's sync-route
  threadpool doesn't guarantee the same thread across calls). 8 new tests; **160 tests, ruff + mypy
  clean.** Scope was plumbing + the existing Game Changer/validation signals only — deepening the
  heuristic signal set (fast mana, tutors, combos, speed) is a later change.
